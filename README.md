# üõ†Ô∏è HashVerifier
HashVerifier is a Windows Forms application in C# that allows you to calculate and verify file hashes using various hash algorithms, with an intuitive and functional interface. It is ideal for verifying the integrity of files and ensuring that they have not been altered.

## üöÄ Description
HashVerifier allows you to calculate and verify file hashes using several algorithms: **MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384**, and **SHA-512**.

## ‚ú® Features
- üìÇ Select a file to calculate its hash.
- üîç Choose the hash algorithm.
- üíæ Save the calculated hash to a file.
- ‚úÖ Verify if the calculated hash matches a given hash.
- üë§ Simple and easy-to-use graphical user interface.

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/QUIENTRAEHIEL0/HashVerifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd HashVerifier`

### Build in Visual Studio
1. Open the project file (`HashVerifier.sln`) in Visual Studio.
2. Build the application by selecting **Build > Build Solution**.
3. Run the application from the Visual Studio environment or through the generated `.exe` file in the `bin` folder.

### Build from the command line (using .NET CLI)
1. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. You can verify it with: `dotnet --version`
2. In the project directory, build the application with the following command: `dotnet build`
3. To run the application after building it, use: `dotnet run --project HashVerifier` Or, if you prefer to run it from the compiled file, navigate to the `bin/Debug/net472` (or `Release` if you used the release build option) folder and run the corresponding `.exe` file.

### üìã Calculate a hash
1. Select the file you want to hash using the **"File to Hash"** button.

5. The calculated hash is saved to the selected path.

### üìã Verify a hash
1. To verify a hash, select the source file (the file you want to calculate the hash for) using the **"Source File"** button.
